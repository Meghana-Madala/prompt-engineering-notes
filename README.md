# Prompt Engineering Notes

This repository documents my learning journey, progress, and hands-on experiments from the **Prompt Engineering & Programming with OpenAI Certification** offered by **Columbia University**.  
It includes foundational AI concepts, coding exercises, chatbot development, and advanced prompt design experiments — all structured to reflect real-world application and continuous learning.

---

## Goal

To develop a deep, practical understanding of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Prompt Engineering**, and **AI-driven application development**.  
Through consistent documentation, this repository aims to serve as both a **knowledge portfolio** and a **technical reference** for my future AI and NLP projects.

---

## Coding Environment  

The coding and experimentation for this certification are primarily conducted using the following platforms:

- **Google Colab** – for Python notebooks and OpenAI API experimentation  
  🔗 [Google Colab Introduction](https://colab.research.google.com/)

- **GitHub** – for version control, project tracking, and documentation  
  🔗 [GitHub Quickstart Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey)

---

## Generative AI Resources  

Generative AI evolves rapidly, and staying current is crucial. These are my core references for learning and updates:

- **OpenAI Documentation** – Official API reference, parameters, and examples  
  🔗 [OpenAI API Docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview?lang=python)

- **LangChain Tutorials** – Guides on building LLM-powered applications and pipelines  
  🔗 [LangChain Python Tutorials](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/)
